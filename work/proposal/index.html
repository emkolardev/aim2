        <p class="proposalIntro">Below are two different product proposals. I'm more excited by the first one, but it may be unrealistically complicated, thus the inclusion of the second (backup) proposal.</p>

            <h3>Product Name:</h3> 
            <p>Undecided, possibly Avancer.</p>

            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>In a nutshell, the service could be described as an Uber-ized version of U-Haul. Users of the service fall into two basic categories:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Those that require use of a vehicle for some moving-related purpose. Maybe they’re moving locally and are able to haul most of their possessions, but they can’t fit a couch into their vehicle and need short-term access to a truck, van, etc. Maybe they don’t own a vehicle, but they just purchased a washer and dryer, and would really like to give someone a small fee to haul it for them instead of paying for a store’s more expensive delivery service. In a less likely (but potential) scenario, maybe they’re moving from St. Louis to Detroit, and would be interested in negotiating an affordable rate with someone who is already making that drive, or would be willing to, and has an accommodating vehicle.</li>
              <li>Those that want to get paid for hauling services, using their own vehicle. These users would have an AirBnb-style profile. This could include information such as a primary location, distance they’re willing to travel, a description and photos of their vehicle, and possibly a base-rate. In addition to the more obvious use scenarios, if this type of user is already planning on making a drive from St. Louis to Detroit and would like to offer hauling services during the trip, the trip information could be posted and made searchable by users that are moving.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A possible alternate version or additional feature would allow users to rent (short-term) personal vehicles from other users to drive themselves and return after. Not sure if this is possible but it would be cool.</p>

            <p>Primarily a web-based service, although if this product were to be fully developed, a mobile app would be a natural and valuable extension.</p>

          <section class="productWhy">
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>I’m a fairly nomadic person- I’ve moved fourteen times in my life, and pretty much yearly since I was eighteen years old (I’m twenty-six now). Five of those moves have been over a distance of at least several hundred miles, the longest ones being from St. Louis to San Francisco, and later from San Francisco to Kalamazoo. Basically, I thrive on change, and get restless being in a single place too long. The downside of that lifestyle is that I’m pretty consistently broke, so the cost of renting moving trucks is major, and is something I’ve only been able to do three times, which has resulted in a lot of stressful moving experiences. I can only imagine how awesome (and fun) it would be to have a lower cost, lower stress, and somewhat more casual option, and to make it available to everyone would be amazing.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="coreAudience">
            <h3>Core Audience:</h3>
            <p>I realize that there probably aren’t a huge number of people that move as often as I do, but at any given time there are a lot of people moving! This service would likely target those living in more populous areas, and mainly those who are either younger (college aged to mid 30s), or who fall into the low-income or middle-class brackets.</p>

            <p>EnRoute.</p>
          <section class-"productDescription">
            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>A map utility that, in addition to the typical, basic functions of existing map utilities (searching locations, getting directions, etc), allows the user to search for things while in the process of following navigation directions. To my knowledge, within existing navigation tools like Google Maps, it is necessary to cancel (“X” out of) the current navigation route and start an entirely new search in order to find something new, then re-do the search for the original location, then re-start route directions. With EnRoute, while the user is already following a set of directions, they could also do a search for a gas station, coffee shop, Walgreens, or any other place, and the application would find those which are on or reasonably close to the route they’re already taking, and the route could then be updated to include directions to the new place.</p>

           <p>Although it could reasonably be a website, this would be most valuable as a smartphone app.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="productWhy">
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>In addition to moving a lot, I absolutely love traveling, and thus take road-trips as often as I possibly can. If I don’t know how to get somewhere, Google Maps routing feature is my best friend. It would be awesome and super useful if the app were more versatile and if the navigation didn’t have to be canceled and restarted anytime I want to find the nearest Starbucks or Shell station. Honestly, that’s too much typing to do while driving or trying to follow directions, and I think it would introduce some after driving practices (at least for me). Plus, it would be nice if it only searched reasonable locations, and not those that are either fifty miles away from where I currently am or that would require significant backtracking.</p>
            <p>Most of all, this project just sounds really fun, and I love building cool things.</p>

            <h3>Core Audience:</h3>
            <p>It sounds vague, but a) smartphone users, and b) those that desire a simpler and/or more streamlined navigation experience. Though this isn’t technically a user group, it does indicate what will be crucial to the design of the app.</p>
